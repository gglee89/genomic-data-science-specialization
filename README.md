# Algorithms for DNA Sequencing

# Technical problems that defines most of the discussions
- Read Alignment problem
- Assembly problem

# What will learn
- Work with some important file formats
- Look at basic patterns and sequencing data
- Naive Exact Matching Algorithm. Simple and not a very fast algorithm to finding patterns in text.
- Different Algorithms and Data Structures

# Why is it important and a timely area of study
- Dna sequencing has become so inexpensive and so good at deliverying lots of data very quickly that sequencers are being used all over the field of life science.
- We can see almost weekly how scientists are applying and refining sequencing to study people's genomes.

# Case studies
- Using sequencing to study genetic diseases in children.
- To sequence the genome of ancient humans (Human origin, evolution, and patterns of migration).
- Studying tumors differently to better figure out how to treat that patient's cancer.
- Using to study the vast number of migrobes, bacterias and such that lives inside our bodies, especially in our guts, and help us do things life digest food.
- Answer basic questions, like what does all the DNA and the genome do? How does the genome work?

# Why study computational genomics?
- Understanding this is key to understand where they will success and where they will fail.

# Data Files
- Reference genome in FASTA format (e.g. lambda_virus.fa)
- Sequencing reads in FASTQ format (e.g. SRR835775_1.first1000.fastq)
- Python Modules (e.g. kmer_index.py)
